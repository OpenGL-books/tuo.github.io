  <div class="ten columns" id="article-content">
    <p>I consider myself as a Rubyist and a minimalist. I want my tools to be few, and sharp. That means I only want few tools, but I want to master these tools.
Now it’s been about a year since I started programming, this post is supposed to give you a look into my toolbox. I hope it can be of inspiration to you.</p>

<p>I’ve open sourced all my dotfiles <a href="http://github.com/Sirupsen/dotfiles">on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="operating-system-linux-and-mac">Operating System: Linux and Mac</h2>

<p>My primary development platform is my desktop running <a href="http://sirupsen.com/my-experience-with-arch-linux" title="See my blog post about my experience with Arch Linux">Arch Linux</a>. It’s a dual screen setup, which I learned to <em>love</em>. I also own a Macbook, primarily used for schoolwork and field coding.</p>

<p>As for my desktop setup of noteworthy tools besides my editor, I use bleeding-edge Chromium as my browser. I might switch to <a href="http://www.uzbl.org/">Uzbl</a> someday. I use <a href="http://openbox.org/wiki">Openbox</a> as my window manager. Sakura as my terminal, simply because it’s lightweight, simple to setup and it does its job.</p>

<p>I have Openbox <a href="http://github.com/Sirupsen/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/openbox/rc.xml">configured to act like Vim</a>, and for Chromium I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">Vimium</a> to achieve the same Vim behavior. In theory I <em>never</em> have to touch my mouse.</p>

<h3 id="shell">Shell</h3>

<p>As for my shell I just use <code>bash</code>. I know the cool kids use <code>zsh</code>, but I simply haven’t bothered to set it up, and I’m really quite happy with <code>bash</code>. </p>

<p>My bash configuration is pretty simple. It just defines some default values, source a few things, and add to my <code>$PATH</code>. It also sets my <code>PS1</code> which consists of only the current directory. I figured that I <em>already know</em> my username, and hostname. Furthermore I really don’t need to know the entire absolute path of the current directory.</p>

<h2 id="editor-vim">Editor: Vim</h2>

<p>I’ve been through many editors. Many. Believe me. A little less than a year ago, a friend recommended me Vim. And I started digging into it. In the beginning, it was hard. But he promised me it’d be worth it. So I sticked to it. In the start, I felt less productive in Vim, because it was somewhat hard to learn. After a few days in it however, I began taking advantage of the endless sets of commands, this all resulted in a <em>more</em> productive me. I now love Vim, and nowadays I almost do all of my text-processing in it: I take notes in Vim, I’m writing this very blog post in Vim, and I make kickass code in Vim.</p>

<p>My Vim setup really is nothing special. I use a few plugins, and I have a small configuration file which is just parts stolen and compiled from others. I can’t remember who I stole what from, though. So they are not credited. I use Monaco as my Vim (and terminal) font, I simply like this font a lot. <a href="http://imgur.com/IdNuY.png">Screenshot</a>.</p>

<h2 id="syncing-dropbox">Syncing: Dropbox</h2>

<p>As I have multiple computers, I sync <em>everything</em> with Dropbox. This also has the benefit of being (additional, I have everything under <code>git</code>, too) backup. My Dropbox holds mostly configuration files and code. The rest is in the cloud. With everything in my Dropbox, I make symbolic links from the Dropbox.</p>

<h3 id="configuration-between-multiple-computers">Configuration between multiple computers</h3>

<p>As I have multiple computers, I want <a href="http://github.com/Sirupsen/dotfiles">my configuration files</a> (<em>dotfiles</em>) to change on other computers as soon as I have changed it somewhere else. In the beginning I had an ugly Rake task to do all this symbolic linking, but later I discovered <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick">Homesick</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Homesick is sorta like rip, but for dotfiles. It uses git to clone a repository containing dotfiles, and saves them in <code>~/.homesick</code>. It then allows you to symlink all the dotfiles into place with a single command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you clone a <code>castle</code>, as they are called in Homesick, it puts the castle in <code>~/.homesick/repos/&lt;repo&gt;</code>, for instance:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>homesick clone Sirupsen/dotfiles <span class="c"># goes to ~/homesick/repos/Sirupsen/dotfiles</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Instead of updating the dotfiles with Git via pulling, however, I wanted it to go through Dropbox, so changes are reflected on my other computers instantly. Later, I can commit these changes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>ln -s Dropbox/dotfiles ~/.homesick/repos/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now I can symlink everything easily:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>homesick symlink dotfiles
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="using-dual-screen-for-coding">Using dual screen for coding</h2>

<p>When I work, I usually work on two monitors. A 19”, and a 24”.</p>

<p>On my 19” I have Pidgin running. This makes me able to talk to colleagues, or friends while working on my other monitor. I might also shring my windows here, and have another terminal open with tests.</p>

<p>On my 24” I have my browser running in the right side, taking up about 50% of horizontal space. When i am coding, this is great for documentation and general googling, githubing and ticket managing while coding. I have experimented with fullscreen Vim, however I just don’t need more than these 80 columns horizontally, so this setup works great. More vertical space is always nice, I’ve heard great things about having a screen that can be turned around to a portrait view for coding. I usually have my terminal running beneath my Vim window, it’s super easy to switch between them with my Openbox Vim configuration.</p>
